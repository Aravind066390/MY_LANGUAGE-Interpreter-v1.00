# MY_LANGUAGE-Interpreter-v1.00
A attempt to test my basic c language understanding by creating a interpreter in C language. it was done in my First year of B.E so now well structured and clean but it works.
Current version is made for Windows 11\n.
To use this download Aravind_lang.exe ,n.txt,n.exe,rules and store it in the same folder then try running Aravind_lang.exe else it will not work.
